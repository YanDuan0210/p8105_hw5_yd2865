## Problem 1

``` r
# checks whether there are duplicate birthdays in the group.
dup_birth = function(n, days = 365) {
  
  birth = sample(1:days, n, replace = TRUE) 
  
  length(unique(birth)) < length(birth) 
}
```

``` r
# simulate 10000 times and calculate the probability.
set.seed(123)
sim_results_df = 
  tibble(n = 2:50) |>
 mutate(
    prob = map_dbl(n,
      ~ mean(replicate(10000, dup_birth(.x))) 
  ))

sim_results_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 49 × 2
    ##        n   prob
    ##    <int>  <dbl>
    ##  1     2 0.0033
    ##  2     3 0.0079
    ##  3     4 0.0158
    ##  4     5 0.0248
    ##  5     6 0.0387
    ##  6     7 0.057 
    ##  7     8 0.0749
    ##  8     9 0.0885
    ##  9    10 0.116

#### Make a plot

``` r
sim_results_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Birthday Problem Simulation (10,000 runs per n)",
    x = "Group size n",
    y = "Pr(at least two share a birthday)"
  ) 
```

**Comments**: As the number of group members increases, the probability
that at least two people in the group have the same birthday gradually
rises. When the group size is small (for example, less than 10 people),
the probability is very low and it is almost impossible for the same
birthday to occur. However, as the number continues to increase, this
probability grows very rapidly. When the number reaches around 23
people, the probability is already close to 0.5, meaning that the chance
of having the same birthday has reached half. By around 50 people, the
probability is almost close to 1, which means that it is almost certain
that there will be two people with the same birthday. This indicates
that a relatively small group can achieve an extremely high probability
of having overlapping birthdays.

## Problem 2
